"""Test setup: make the package importable, and keep the tests off the network.

Without the path line, `pytest tests/` puts only the tests directory on the
path and the imports fail, while `python -m pytest` happens to work because it
adds the working directory. Pinning it here means both spellings behave the
same on any machine.

The network guard exists because of a real CI failure. A test asserted that the
model resolver falls back to a hardcoded list, and it passed for weeks, but only
because the machine it was written on could not reach the model catalogue. The
moment it ran somewhere with working network the fetch succeeded, the resolver
returned real models, and the assertion broke. A test whose result depends on
whether the network happens to be reachable is not testing anything. So a real
HTTP call inside a test now fails loudly instead of quietly changing the answer.
